# Underwater Image Enhancement 


## About


This work is implementation of ["Color Balance and Fusion for Underwater Image Enhancement"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8058463)  published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing ( Volume: 27, Issue: 1, Jan. 2018).


The work provided a fusion-based technique for improving underwater image quality with little complexity and excellent efficiency. 

The procedure included three crucial steps:
The first step is to figure out how to provide acceptable
inputs. Second, choose appropriate weight maps. Third, perform multiscale fusion .

In a nutshell, the background facts and related algorithms are presented.
